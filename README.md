# Vrinda-Store-Report-2022
This project involved analyzing the 2022 sales data of Vrinda Stores to derive actionable business insights. The process began with an in-depth exploration of the dataset to identify and address key issues, including removing duplicate records and handling null values through data cleaning techniques. A pivot table was created to summarize the information, while charts and graphs were used for effective visualization of the trends.

An interactive Excel dashboard, equipped with slicers, was developed to enable dynamic exploration of the data. The analysis revealed valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, such as gender-based buying trends, the performance of various sales channels, top-performing states, and the age-gender relationship in purchase patterns. Additionally, the highest-selling product category was identified.

Based on these findings, recommendations were proposed to boost sales, including targeting female customers, emphasizing popular sales channels, and focusing marketing efforts on high-performing states. These strategies aim to enhance sales performance in 2023 by aligning marketing initiatives with data-driven insights.
